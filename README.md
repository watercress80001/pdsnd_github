## **Welcome to Bikeshare!**

This project is called (you guessed it) Bikeshare. It's a simple command-line project that allows the user to summarize bikesharing data for the following cities:
* Chicago
* New York City
* Washington

The user also has the option to read through raw data files, if they desire. I believe the project will be easiest to use with terminal but should be useable with any command prompt or terminal capable of running python3.


--------------
### **Creation Dates**

The bikeshare project was created on 07/20/2022. It was a Wednesday :-)

The project readme was later created on 08/13/2022. That was a Saturday.

As of 08/13/2022, this project is contained in a repo named *pdsnd_github*[^2] in GitHub.


[^2]: I think this stands for **P**ersonal **D**ata **S**cience **N**ano **D**egree but I'm not sure.

----
### **Files used**
Data Files accessed by the project are: 
- chicago.csv
- new\_york\_city.csv
- washington.csv

**Important:** 

These files are not included in this repo, so you will need access to the Udacity data files or similar data files on your own machine. These files will need to be stored in a "data" folder in the same repository as the bikeshare python file. *The code will not run successfully without the csv files in the designated folder.*

You will need to have python3 installed and a working terminal or command prompt to run this project. 
This code has not been tested on terminal/bash GUI apps and there has been limited testing using Jupyter notebooks. The presumption is that the code will run on any of these apps but there may be unforeseen bugs and/or issues.

### **Credits**
It's important to give proper credit. 
Some of the readme's and other resources I used when constructing this readme are:

*Readme info:*
- [Chrome Lighthouse readme](https://github.com/watercress80001/lighthouse/blob/b0a9b0b948c41e57a33575634963a84ede81f631/readme.md)
- [makeMKV\_Readme](/makeMKV_Readme.rtf) This is a readme for a program I'm using to archive my dvds.
- [GitHub Markdown Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) This was used to double check my markdown choices.
- as well as countless other readme's I've read over the years (these have been lost to old computers--may they rest in peace).

*Vim info:*

I was very distressed when I learned that Atom would sunset in Dec 2022. VS Code is the natural substitute but for some reason I just don't like it. Instead, I've been using vim as much as possible for the git segment of my nano degree. To manage it, I've used the following sites (after googling the question):
   
- [opening files](https://blog.confirm.ch/mastering-vim-opening-files/)
- [text navigation](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/03/8-essential-vim-editor-navigation-fundamentals/)
- [undo, redo](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Undo_and_Redo)

- [Vim Tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-EPvfxcgl0) Overkill for my current needs but I can use it later :-)

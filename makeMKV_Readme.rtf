{\pard Thank you for trying out MakeMKV beta. MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own into free and patents-unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format converter or "transcoder". The only thing it does (and does well) - it converts the video clips from proprietary (and usually encrypted) disk into a set of MKV files, preserving most information but not changing it in any way. The MKV format can store multiple video/audio tracks with all meta-information and preserve chapters. There are lots of players that can play MKV files nearly on all platforms.

{\pard Mac OS Unidentified Developer warning
\par}
{\pard -------------------------------------
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard The MakeMKV application is not signed by Apple developer certificate. Latest versions of Mac OS prevent opening such applications with a message that the developer cannot be verified and app could contain malware.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard As a matter of fact MakeMKV application is signed - just not using the method that Apple enforces. Anyone can validate authenticity of MakeMKV install image using hash file available at http://www.makemkv.com/download/ .
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard All versions of Mac OS still allow user to override the default policy and install any application - this requires opening the MakeMKV in Applications folder while holding an option key. Please see the Apple support article at https://support.apple.com/HT202491 for details.
